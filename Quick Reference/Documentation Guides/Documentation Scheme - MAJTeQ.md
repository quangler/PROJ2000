## Introduction:
This document is relating to how we will make all of our documents look when in relation to MAJTeQ.
We will be using Markdown for text editing, but we need to have a method that we all follow to make our documents have the same formatting.
Here is the solution:

**Naming for documents:** `<thing it is> - MAJTeQ`
**Header Sizing:**
- **title:** `#`
- **project name:** `##`
- **project headers:** `##`
- **assigned members, date last modified, version:** `titles bold, data is normal in the same line`

**Headers will end with a colon:**
(ex.) `## <Header Name>:`

**After initial document BLOCK we will put a line:**
`---` 
Information under headers will be in bullet points or in paragraphs

**Colour Scheme:** Taqi has decided on a scheme for the networking diagrams. Markdown defaults will be used for colour scheme, further discussion needed.

**General header for everything example:**
