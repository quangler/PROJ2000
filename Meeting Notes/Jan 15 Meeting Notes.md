Topics discussed - what we talked about (brief):

Meetings - we should have an agenda and a declarative start time. We haven't done this so far ðŸ˜¢
Full Input - giving your thoughts on decisions, if we have to grill people for their choice then so be it.
Feedback/Criticism will be through a sandwich method. Hit them with kindness, then what they can change, then furthermore another compliment. ðŸ˜„
Accountability - ensure you are keeping up with the schedule, if you aren't let people know


Outcomes - decisions we made
- [ ] we will end meetings with golf claps
- [ ]  WHEN ARE THE DOCUMENTS DO?
- [ ] WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO NEXT?
  
TLDR - notes summed up:
- make sure to declare when meetings happen, otherwise notes won't be taken (whoops)
- participate in conversations, tell people how you feel about your work or theirs.
