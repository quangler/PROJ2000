###### Tuckman model - 5 stages of working with a team:
**Forming** - figuring out where everyone fits
**Storming** - resistance, struggle, fighting
**Norming** - figuring it out, lowered anxiety 
**Performing** - this is where the flow state hits, we are just working it all out
**Adjourning** - the ending, recognition of team efforts

Training - project managers recommend that people take courses to improve individual and team development
Team building activities - physical challenges (ex. going for lunch, coffee, etc.) psychological preference indicator tools (Meyers Briggs type indicator)

###### General Advice on Managing Teams
5 dysfunctions of teams:
- **absence of trust** - invulnerability (don't discuss with team because they don't trust each other)
- **fear of conflict** - artificial harmony (no one is fighting so its all good! not really)
- **lack of commitment** - ambiguity (no one really cares, just doing things to do them)
- **avoidance of accountability** - low standards (no one wants to take charge or do anything)
- **inattention to results** - status and ego (results don't matter, rather just complete things half-assed to say they did it)
general advice:
- be patient & kind to your team (if you're running out of time then i mean shit lets get things going)
- fix the problem instead of blaming people
- establish regular, **effective** meetings
- allow time for teams to go through the basic team-building stages - [[#Tuckman model - 5 stages of working with a team]]

- stress team identity
- nurture team members and encourage them to help each other
- acknowledge individual and group accomplishments
- take additional actions to work with virtual team members
