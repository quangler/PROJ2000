Topics (agenda):
- what are we going to do for sites ?!
- good, better, best - start slow and go crazy after?
- everyone chips in for network

Topics discussed - what we talked about (brief):
1. Sites !?
	- what sites are we going to build physically? - HQ and Plant for sure - could possibly build a warehouse too.
	- are we cool with just showing some virtualized infrastructure (EVE)? - way on the back burner - 
	- do we say "this site is identical, but we are using this technology `<insert VM with thing on>`"

matt idea: use the physical hardware for HQ and plant
- use EVE for virtualizing the two warehouses

2. should we aim for the middle just to make sure we can get everything done before going to best?
	- make sure we hit everything before 

4. make sure everyone takes part in the network to make sure they understand - we are going to plan as a team now
	- good documentation
	- people need to read the documentation
	

Outcomes - decisions we made
- [ ] - plan the network together
- [ ] we will create multiple sites (HQ, PLANT for sure, Warehouse probably)
- [ ] aim for better, then upgrade to best if we can later.
TLDR - notes summed up:
teamwork! planning is better now that there are many of us  
we will build probably 3 sites
