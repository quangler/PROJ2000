# Project Management Process Groups
## Introduction
Project management consists of 10 knowledge areas:
- integration
- scope
- schedule
- cost
- quality
- resource
- communications
- risk
- procurement
- stakeholder management
Projects involve five project management process groups
- initiating - ex. screenwriting
- planning - ex. producing
- executing - ex. acting and directing
- monitoring and controlling - ex. editing
- closing - ex. releasing the movie

An Alpha Project Manager is considered a top project manager - they spend more time executing and planning than other project managers.

Organizations that are successful in project management complete 89% of their projects, where as those who are poor at project management complete only 36%.
- poor performance costs $109 million for every billion input.
#### Project Pre-Initiation and Initiation
Initiating includes recognizing and starting a new project
- right kinds of projects for the right reasons
Strategic planning should serve as the foundation for deciding which project to pursue
- express the goals of the project (vision, mission, objectives, strategies of the company)
- provides the basis for IT planning
##### Pre-initiation Tasks
Develop the scope, time, and cost constraint for the project
#### Initiating
Initiate knowledge areas, processes, and outputs.
##### Developing the Project Charter - the birth of the project
- working with stakeholders to create a document that authorizes a project
- short and include key project information, also have stakeholder signatures
- the project charter is what creates a billing number for the project. - for costs, payments, etc.
##### Developing an IT Project *Management* Plan
- a unique approach to project management - many companies make their own methodologies for project management
- a methodology describes **how** things should be done
- a standard describes **what** should be done
##### Project Kick-off Meeting
a meeting that allows for the whiteboarding of project plans
- a brief overview, just to get the project going.
#### Project Planning
Purpose is to guide execution
Key outputs:
- team contract
- project scope statement
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Project schedule (in the form of a Gantt chart - all dependencies and resources entered)
- list of prioritized risks (part of risk register)
#### Project Execution
Typically the most resource intensive
- hits all knowledge areas
- Focuses on deliverables
- documented change requests and update planning documents
Keeping to the schedule is a big part
- milestone reports can help focus on completing major milestones
#### Project Monitoring and Controlling
Involves measuring progress toward project objectives, monitors deviation from the plan, taking corrective actions
- affects all other process groups and occurs during all phases of the project life cycles
This will be where you might want to change things up in the planning
##### Change Control System
- documented process that describes when and how official project documents and work may be changed - this is important, need authorization otherwise you shouldn't be doing it
- describes who can make the change, and how we are making the changes
- affects: scope, schedule, budget.
#### Project Closing
Involves gaining stakeholder and customer acceptance of the final products and services
- even if the projects are not completed, they should be closed out to learn from the past
- outputs may include:
	- project files
	- lessons-learned reports - often one of the most important things to the project teams
	- final report
	- presentation
