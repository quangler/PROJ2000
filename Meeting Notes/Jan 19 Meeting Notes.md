Topics discussed - what we talked about (brief):

1. Started splitting up the tasks for the WBS - splitting up documentation for multiple people to do (rather than just a group of all of us doing them 1 at a time).
	- setting that bad boy up as a CSV to put it into Proof Hub

2. Using Proof Hub instead of discord for anything relating to project work
- discussions - progress reports (end of day summary), meeting notes
	2a. Discord will now be used for **informal** communications only

3. GitHub: will be used for final documentation / formal documents
- has things getting pulled for notes -> lets call it redundancy
- in the future using it for hosting documentation website

4. Ticketing will be used for problems and explanation of tasks specifically - separate from the proof hub which will be used for task management  

Outcomes - decisions we made
- [ ] We are using Proof Hub now for anything PROJ related
- [ ] Discord is purely informal communications
- [ ] GitHub will be used for formal/final documentation -> allows us to host documentation
  
TLDR - notes summed up:
