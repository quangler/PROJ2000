*SUBJECT TO CHANGE*

no one has really started the project management stuff, we should hit that up sometime soon 
- that would help us focus on the build in the upcoming weeks

make a super generalized plan for everything:
- we need IP address scheme
- name scheme
- general document format - markdown, ariel, title blocks


Outcomes - decisions we made
- [ ] start breaking down the WBS by actual task under heading
- [ ] make a generalized scheme for everything
  
TLDR - notes summed up:
assigning the WBS (part 2)
get documentation going - helps us in the future
general scheme for everything - will help "brand identity"
