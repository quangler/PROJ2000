## Current Situation and Problem/Opportunity Statement

### **Current /Problems:**

- We are tasked with Interconnecting 4 different sites.
- The current system infrastructure is dilapidated & in need of overhaul.
- Replacing old network infrastructure E.g. (Wiring, phone systems, etc.)
- Implementation of new cloud system that integrates with AD environments.
- With the Acquiring of new building, the need for a new network implementing, deployment (LAN, WLAN, Security) of those sites. While upgrading headquarters.

### **Opportunity:**

- The goal of implementing new offered technologies for the organization.
- The need for a comprehensive overhaul to meet the demands of the modern business environment.
- The challenge is to create a robust and secure IT foundation that not only integrates seamlessly with UES's existing structures but also facilitates the transition to a more efficient and digitally driven operational model.
- This project will not only enhance the security and efficiency of operations but also contribute to the successful implementation of their prefabricated solar and wind-based power generation systems in the market.

## Critical Assumption and Constraints

**The critical constraints we faced with this project are as follow:**

- We are optimistic that the clients, together with their collaborators, will successfully complete their assigned tasks and deliver the project to us within the agreed timeframe. which will allow us to start work on our phase of the upgrade.
- We are assuming that MAJTEQ would have ALL required and proper physical access to all building areas, that is essential for us complementing the jobs.
- We are hoping to have minimal impact on the overall production of the organization, where having a temporary/ backup system in place so workers can still execute their tasks.
- Ensure from a Budget perspective the solution cannot cost over $500k.

## Analysis of Option and Recommendation

The purpose of options analysis is Identifying that the current business environment needs a huge upgrade of the IT infrastructure, our general plan to tackle the question "what/which is the best choice?".

It would be a system that first *identifies the Options*:

- **Where is the change needed?**
  - Network system, Server system & Application.
- **What approach should we take?**
  - Should we adopt a do-nothing approach?
  - Should we adopt a do-minimum approach?
  - Should we adopt a do-something approach?

### **Would the system be valuable to the Project?**

  - Would the solution generate money or profit the business.
  - Would the solution offer short-term or long-term opportunities.

### **Would the solution be Feasibility with the scope of work?**

  - Do we have the resources to pursue this option?
- How much is such an option going to cost to implement?
- How much is such an option going to cost to maintain?

### **Recommendation:**

- We have conducted surveys through our stakeholders to get ideas on some use cases. What are user suggestions on new systems?
- We will be releasing demos & training a sample size of user, while gathering feedback.
- We may put things to a vote if the solutions are within marginal difference.

## Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis
