#### What is Project Scope Management?
Scope refers to **all the work involved** in creating the products of the project and the processes used to create them
- project scome management includes defining and controlling what is or is not included in a project

#### Project Scope Management Processes
Main processes:
- **Planning Scope Management**: determining how the project's scope and requirements can be managed
- **Collecting Requirements**: defining and documenting the project elements as well as the processes for making those elements
- **Defining Scope**: reviewing the project charter, requirements documents, and organizational process assets to create a scope statement
- **Creating the WBS**: breaking down the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components
- **Validating Scope**: formalizing acceptance of the project deliverables
- **Controlling Scope**: controlling changes to project scope throughout the life of the project

#### Planning Scope Management
project team uses expert judgement, data analysis, and meetings to develop two important outputs:
- scope management plan (part of the project management plan)
- requirements management plan
##### Scope management plan contents
- prepare a detailed project scope statement
- create a WBS
- maintain and approve the WBS
- obtain formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
- control requests for changes to the project scope

##### Collecting Requirements
- interviewing stakeholders
- holding focus groups / workshops
- using creativity and decision-making techniques
- using questionnaires and surveys

#### Defining Scope
important parts of a project scope statement:
- product scope description
- product user acceptance criteria
- detailed information on all project deliverables
also helpful to document:
- project boundaries, constraints, assumptions
- supporting document reference
scope should resolve to be clearer over time

#### Creating the work breakdown structure
**WBS** - deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project
- foundation document that provides the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes
**Decomposition** - is the main tool or technique for creating a WBS
- subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces
- a work package is a task at the lowest level of the WBS

Approaches to developing WBS:
- **analogy approach**: review WBSs of similar projects and tailor to your project
- **top-down approach**: start with largest items of the project and break them down
- **bottom-up approach**: start with specific tasks
- **mind mapping**: uses branches radiating out from a core idea to structure thoughts and ideas

#### The WBS Dictionary
- many WBS are vague or use language that only makes sense to the professionals in that sector
	- WBS dictionary is a document that describes detailed information about each WBS item
advice for creating a WBS and WBS dictionary
- unit of work should appear at only one place in the WBS
- work content of a WBS item is the sum of the WBS items below it
- WBS item is the responsibility of only one individual, even though many people may be working on it
- project team members should be involved in developing the WBS to ensure consistency and buy-in
- WBS must be a flexible tool to accommodate inevitable changes while properly maintaining control of the work content in the project according to the scope statement

#### Validating Scope
it is difficult to create a good project scope statement and WBS for a project
- even more difficult, especially on IT projects, to verify the project scope and minimize scope changes
Scope creep may occur - tendency for project scope to get bigger
**scope validation involves a FORMAL ACCEPTANCE** of the completed project deliverables

#### Controlling Scope
scope control involves controlling changes to the project scope
- keeping project goals and business strategy in mind
goals of scope control:
- influence the factors that cause scope changes
- ensure changes are processed according to procedures developed as part of integrated change control
- manage changes when they occur
suggestions for improving user input:
- conduct regular meetings with defined agendas
- deliver something to users and sponsors on a regular basis
- do not promise to deliver what the team cannot deliver in a particular time frame
