To reduce risks and Challenges, we will evaluate expectations, alternatives/changes, project stages, and financial investments by developing a business case & applying a disciplined approach. Aiming to provide guidance on the right course of action that will define the corporate values of the company.

## Business Objectives

### Project Objectives

Over the next four months, we want to establish a planning framework that prioritizes operational, developmental, and strategic plans to ensure UES's sustained success and support for our overarching goals. Our approach consists of four steps:

- To make expectations and responsibilities clearer.
- To set collaborative goals and targets.
- To give all staff members and stakeholders at all management level performance reviews and while sharing findings.
- To foster team collaboration and involvement to finish the project on schedule and within the financial budgets.
- Identifying existing strengths that can be leveraged throughout the transformation phase.

### Technical Objectives

Technical objective is meant to show us how to translate our ideas into realistic, scalable business potential. applying the business viewpoint, which examines how the concept may be implemented by taking factors such as organizational & business changes, technological solutions, and ecosystem effects.

- When implemented correctly, the road map offers useful, business-driven guidelines for locating, creating, and delivering new services and technologies.
- ensure our concepts are viable and worthy of being pushed further.
- Ensuring the innovation process stays creative and allows for the unlimited sharing of ideas.
- Executing the design & thinking about each step flawlessly whereby refining our concepts during the brainstorming and proofreading stages.

## Current Situation and Problem/Opportunity Statement

### Current Problems

- We are tasked with Interconnecting 4 different sites.
- The current system infrastructure is dilapidated & in need of overhaul.
- Replacing old network infrastructure E.g. (Wiring, phone systems, etc.)
- Implementation of new cloud system that integrates with AD environments.
- With the Acquiring of new building, the need for a new network implementing, deployment (LAN, WLAN, Security) of those sites. While upgrading headquarters.

### Opportunity

- The goal of implementing new offered technologies for the organization.
- The need for a comprehensive overhaul to meet the demands of the modern business environment.
- The challenge is to create a robust and secure IT foundation that not only integrates seamlessly with UES's existing structures but also facilitates the transition to a more efficient and digitally driven operational model.
- This project will not only enhance the security and efficiency of operations but also contribute to the successful implementation of their prefabricated solar and wind-based power generation systems in the market.

## Critical Assumption and Constraints

**The critical constraints we faced with this project are as follow:**

- We are optimistic that the clients, together with their collaborators, will successfully complete their assigned tasks and deliver the project to us within the agreed time frame. which will allow us to start work on our phase of the upgrade.
- We are assuming that MAJTeQ would have ALL required and proper physical access to all building areas, that is essential for us complementing the jobs.
- We are hoping to have minimal impact on the overall production of the organization, where having a temporary/ backup system in place so workers can still execute their tasks.
- Ensure from a Budget perspective the solution cannot cost over $500k.

## Analysis of Option and Recommendation

The purpose of options analysis is Identifying that the current business environment needs a huge upgrade of the IT infrastructure, our general plan to tackle the question "what/which is the best choice?".

It would be a system that first *identifies the Options*:

**Where is the change needed?**
- Network system, Server system & Application.
**What approach should we take?**
- Should we adopt a do-nothing approach?
- Should we adopt a do-minimum approach?
- Should we adopt a do-something approach?

**Would the system be valuable to the Project?**

- Would the solution generate money or profit the business.
- Would the solution offer short-term or long-term opportunities.

**Would the solution be Feasibility with the scope of work?**

- Do we have the resources to pursue this option?
- How much is such an option going to cost to implement?
- How much is such an option going to cost to maintain?

### Recommendation

- We have conducted surveys through our stakeholders to get ideas on some use cases. What are user suggestions on new systems?
- We will be releasing demos & training a sample size of user, while gathering feedback.
- We may put things to a vote if the solutions are within marginal difference.

## Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis

**See Appendix (Budget: Preliminary)**

# Project Management Plan - MAJTeQ
**Project Name: UltraSol Energy Solutions Merger**
**Date Last Modified:** January 24, 2024  
**Version:** 1.00  

--- 
## Project Overview
Throughout this project, management will be handled as a shared effort. Each member is encouraged to express their thoughts and ideas whenever they believe it to be important. All members shall be open-minded and willing to work with each other.
## Project Team Organization
MAJTeQ is comprised of five members which can be found in the header under the section "Assigned Members". The team will create and follow standards for organizing tasks, documentation, and other items such as diagrams or demonstrations.
### Team Roles and Responsibilities
Each member of MAJTeQ is considered an equal and shall be treated accordingly. As it currently stands, there are general sections of the project that will be spearheaded by each member of the team. More information on this can be found within the Work Breakdown Sheet document. The sections have thus far been broken into: storage, network backbone, network front facing, security, cloud, and monitoring.
### Monitoring and Controlling Plans
Team meetings are held at the start of each work period to ensure the tasks that must be completed are at the forethought of the team. Tasks in the Work Breakdown Sheet will be given a general schedule timeline for the time being, and will be updated as the project progresses. If a task is considered behind, that will be focused on by the assignee. If the task is still not able to be completed, the task will be assigned to another member with less tasks or who is waiting for the first task to be completed.
## Decision Making
Decisions will be a team effort with a three-vote system put into place. Official change requests will follow the MAJTeQ change request form template, needing three members of the team to agree in order for the change to go through. 
## Conflict Resolution
Conflict resolution will be handled via the members involved with the conflict through communication. If communicating does not lead to resolution within a reasonable time period, a member of the team will attempt conflict resolution via communication. If the conflict persists, an instructor will be involved.

# Communication Management Plan - MAJTeQ
**Project Name: UltraSol Energy Solutions Merger**
**Date Last Modified:** January 29, 2024  
**Version:** 1.03  

---
## Stakeholder Communications Requirements
Communications to stakeholders will be through formal documents with a standardized structure. This structure will contain a uniform title block, text sizing, font, and general text style - paragraph or bullet form. Communications to stakeholders shall be on time as requested by the stakeholder, completed to the fullest ability of the team.
## Communications Summary
Throughout the course of this project communication will be focused upon in order to maintain a collective understanding of the general project, as opposed to an individual only having knowledge of their own sections. The following schedule will be used to ensure this:  

| **Stakeholder**           | **Communications Name** | **Delivery Method/Format**                                                | **Producer**    | **Due/Frequency**                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Project Team              | Daily Meeting           | Short meeting with digital copy of notes, uploaded in GitHub and ProofHub | Quinn Parent    | Start of free time during PROJ class as needed |
| Project Managers and Team | Weekly Status Report    | Pre-Filled in document brought up during a meeting.                       | Project Manager | Alternating Wednesday and Thursdays            |
During the daily meeting, notes will be taken and uploaded to the discussion section of the ProofHub with the title of that "day's date meeting notes". The notes will also be pushed to the GitHub repository that the team maintains for formal and general PROJ2000 documents.
## Comments/Guidelines
Communication between the team members will be mostly informal with general project related communications taking place in person or through ProofHub discussions. Other non-project relating communications will take place on discord, examples of these would be alerting the team of an absence or late arrival. Meeting notes have a general template that should be followed for clarity sake; changes may be made in the future. Other documents that may be needed will follow their own general template as well, this will streamline the documentation process. Communications with stakeholders, as mentioned, will be in a more formal setting, following the title block, text sizing, and general text style structure that has been pre-set.
when reporting to team members vs. stakeholders
## Escalation Procedures for Resolving Issues
Escalation shall be done when a task is falling behind and the team member that is assigned to said task is unable to complete it in a timely manner. The expectation is for the team member to let the other members know during the daily meetings that they will be working on the task, or if they are unable to, let the team know so another member can help out. Depending on the task, it can be fully transferred over to another team member, or just have a second team member to help streamline the process. If a team member is falling behind on a task and does not let anyone know, inspection of the WBS progress in the Gantt chart will notify the team and allow for intervention if needed.
## Revision Procedures for this Document
Revisions will be made to this, or any other document, as needed. The expectation for updating a document is to reversion the document in the title block, and let the team know when it is possible - whether that be through ProofHub, in-person, or even in Discord. Any document amendments are also expected to be put committed to the GitHub with a sufficient comment mentioning that the document has been updated, and possibly a brief overview of the changes made if they could be easily overlooked.
## Glossary of Common Terminology
This list will be updated as terminology is expanded.
- VM - Virtual Machine - a virtual computer.  
- Hypervisor - a server that is able to have other virtual computers on it.  
- HA - High Availability - being able to have one server that can go down without it being noticeable to the end users.

# Change Control Plan - MAJTeQ
**Project Name: UltraSol Energy Solutions Merger**

**Date Last Modified:** January 29, 2024  
**Version:** 1.00  

---
## Purpose
This document is to describe how documents and infrastructure changes can be made and the process of said changes. This is due to the active project at hand, meaning things will change as progression continues.

## How to use this Document
The Change Control Plan will be used to track committed changes and follow-through with confirmed changes from change request forms.

### Documentation
Documentation will have less restrictions on changes than the infrastructure as it is versioned and commits can be tracked through GitHub.  
Changes can be made by any member of the team at any time. If a change is made it is expected that the version of the document will be updated, and any changes made will briefly be described in the commit message to GitHub. The document should also be versioned in ProofHub under the task it relates to.

### Project Infrastructure
Changes related to project infrastructure will have more restrictions attached to them as they are more impactful towards the project as a whole, and are not versioned in the same way that project documents are.

#### Step 1 - Identify Needed Changes
- Identify a change that needs to be made in the project and note the reasons why.
- Fill out the Change Request Form Template to reflect the identified changes needed.

Changes that are considered large enough to be accepted are:
- Changes to the timeline, specifically extensions of a week or more that cannot be resolved by 
- Change of approved scope.
- Result of a risk - infrastructure needs to be repaired or changed.
  
#### Step 2 - Submit Change Request Form
- Submit the completed Change Request Form to the Project Management Control directory for review.   
- The form should include a detailed description of the change, the reason for it, and any potential impacts on the project.

#### Step 3 - Review of Change Request
- The Change Request Form will need to be accepted by a majority of the team in order to be accepted.
- This review process may involve a meeting or discussion among the team members to understand the implications of the proposed change.
- A group decision will be made regarding the approval of the change and any refused Change Request Forms will be marked 'Denied'.
- A member of the project team will be assigned to any approved change for overseeing its progress. 

#### Step 4 - Implementation of Change
- The member assigned to manage the change, will implement the change and document the progress on the Change Request Form.
- A sub-task will be assigned in ProofHub to facilitate the change and its progress.
- The managing assigned member will ensure that the change is implemented as planned and that it achieves the desired outcome.

#### Step 5 - Monitor and Control
- The member assigned to manage the change, will monitor the impact of the change on the project and take any needed action if necessary.
- This could involve additional changes or adjustments to the project plan.

# Project Risk Management Plan - MAJTeQ
**Project Name: UltraSol Energy Solutions Merger**
**Date Last Modified:** January 31, 2024  
**Version:** 1.00  

---
## Introduction

This Risk Management Plan outlines the approach that MAJTeQ will employ to manage risks for the UltraSol Energy Solutions IT infrastructure merger project. The project’s primary objective is to establish a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the feasibility of a technology solution for the merged entities of UltraSol Energy Solutions (UES) and Solar-Tec. The success of this project hinges on a seamless merger of the two companies and their IT systems, minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. This plan will guide the team in identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, monitoring their occurrence, and planning for their resolution.

## Risk Management Processes 

The MAJTeQ Group will employ a systematic approach to risk management. This includes identifying potential risks through:
- Brainstorming sessions
- Consulting with expert resources
- Analysis of project documents
  
Each identified risk will be documented in a risk register, detailing the potential impact and probability of the risk, as well as potential response strategies.

## Risk Response Planning 
Risk Response Planning is the process of selecting the appropriate response strategy for each identified risk. This plan helps the project to avoid risks, transfer responsibility for risks, mitigate the consequences of risks, and reduce the probability of occurrence of risks.

## Strategies for Managing Risks

- **Avoid**: Risk Avoidance involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat posed by the risk. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining additional information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise.
- **Transfer**: Transferring a risk requires moving, shifting, or reassigning some or all of the negative impact and ownership to a third party. This does not eliminate the risk but gives another party the responsibility to manage it.
- **Mitigate**: Risk Mitigation implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of a negative risk. Reducing the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring is often more effective than dealing with the risk after it has occurred.
- **Accept**: This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan: schedule, approach, or reduce project scope, or is unable to identify another suitable response strategy.
