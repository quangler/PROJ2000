## Project Communications Management
Miscommunication - didn't have your words be understood
Lack of communication - didn't say anything
#### How should we communicate? 
If we have too many methods of communication, you could spend time looking for the info you need.
- communication management becomes important here,
- make sure you have a single organized place to put information
- mark down your **action** that you will do (useful for meetings)

#### Importance of Project Communications Management
##### Greatest threat to many projects is a failure to communicate
- You can't just get by on purely technical skill
- Everyone on the team needs to have both types of skills to be successful
##### Main processes in project communications management
- planning communications management
- managing communications
- monitoring communications

#### Focusing on Group and Individual Communication Needs
##### People are not interchangeable parts
- can't assume that everyone works at the same speed
- multiple people can't cut the time in half
#### Formal and informal methods of communicating
How are you going to communicate, or how are you going to do work?
- do it during class time or doing it after school?
- informal communications can be helpful, but make sure to write things down
#### Distributing information in an effective and timely manner
- make sure to include things that will effect other team members
- "domain of language" - things that make sense to you, but may not mean anything to someone else
	- make sure you use the same "domain"
- document any changes in tech specs that may affect anything
- report bad news - blunt honesty | what you were attempting, what went wrong, plan to fix
- quick, frequent meetings - make sure to document stuff
	- lets people know about changes that have happened without their knowledge
#### Bad news communications
Put the info in context, what were you trying to do?
- then explain how the issue happened and what you did to fix it.
- explain how the fix is going to exist

Make sure the whole team has heard the news for when you need to change something that may break.
- "hey im gonna restart the DC" - make sure to say loud.

#### Planning Communications Management
##### Make a plan for communications
- make sure everyone knows where to look for information
- **figure this out early - what is the organization method we are using**
- how urgent is the communication needed?
- how do you get to people when you need to?
- communication frequency? at the start of the day? or do you want to know right now?
**the procedure should be revised if it is not working** 
What is the expectation for level of quality of work?
- discuss how documentation and messaging should look
- issues will be exacerbated, make sure to find a solution.
##### Performance Reporting
Peer reviews, how do we settle conflicts in terms of work being done.
- progress reports - what the team has accomplished during a certain period of time
- status reports - where the project stands at a specific point
- forecasts - predict future status, progress based on past information and trends - PROJ1000 is not gonna be how PROJ2000 works. we make the schedule
#### Global Issues
- language
	- does everyone speak the same language at the same level?
- cultural differences
	- holidays
	- time zone difference
##### Meetings
- be as efficient as possible
- make an agenda - what is the goal of the meeting | template
	- give an early agenda so people can think about it | perchance
- record it all - what is the planned action - who is acting upon it etc. | make a quick notes at the end for looking back or afk people
- formally ending the meeting - let you add anything extra at this point
- was everyone available to give input?
- if there is nothing to meet about, don't have a meeting
- if you need to show people something, have it ready
#### Emails
- make sure you send your email to the right people: to and cc
- use meaningful subject lines - EOM (end of message)
- be clear and concise
- re-read email before you sent it - add recipients last
- manage email size (some have limits)
- delete or sort emails
