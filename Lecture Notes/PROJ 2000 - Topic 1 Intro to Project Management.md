## Intro to Project Management
#### Triple Constraint
cost - can it be completed under budget?
time - can it be completed in a timely manor?
scope - does it complete what needs to be completed?
if your project does not hit one of these - the project technically failed
#### Advantages of using formal project management
- better control of resources (financial, physical, HR) - make sure everyone has something to do, no waiting around & no one working extra long hours
- improved customer relations - not just customers for your business, using other companies (contractors, MSPs)
- shorter implementation times
- lower costs and improved productivity
- higher profit margins - company love money
- better internal coordination
- positive impact on meeting strategic goals - higher ups want a grand goal -> things then happen based on those


#### What is a project
- temporary job to get something done
- stand-alone project or a component of a larger project
- a project has value to a company - unique purpose
- developed through progressive elaboration - spit-balling until you get an idea and can go from there
- requires resources
- the end of a project is when all the objectives have been reached (or you get fired)
phases of a project:
- initial phase - planning, finding out what you need
- intermediate phases - actually doing the project
- closing phase - documentation and presentation of project

#### Project Managers
- don't have to know everything about the project
- have to know how to manage people that know what the project is all about
- just wanna hit that [[#Triple Constraint]]

#### Stakeholders
- Anyone who is involved or affected by project activities
	- anyone who works on the project
	- anyone who is against the project

#### Knowledge Areas
Key competencies that project managers need:
- scope - hitting all the elements we need?
- time
- cost
- quality
- communications
- risk - is something uncertain, can we get through it?
- HR - do we have the right people?
- procurement - how do I get the components I need (people, or things)?
- stake holder
- **project integration** - how everything comes together
