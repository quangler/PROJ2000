## Purpose:
This document is to describe how documents and infrastructure changes can be made and the process of said changes. This is due to the active project at hand, meaning things will change as progression continues.

## How to use this Document:
The Change Control Plan will be used to track committed changes and follow-through with confirmed changes from change request forms.

### Documentation
Documentation will have less restrictions on changes than the infrastructure as it is versioned and commits can be tracked through GitHub.  
Changes can be made by any member of the team at any time. If a change is made it is expected that the version of the document will be updated, and any changes made will briefly be described in the commit message to GitHub. The document should also be versioned in ProofHub under the task it relates to.

### Project Infrastructure
Changes related to project infrastructure will have more restrictions attached to them as they are more impactful towards the project as a whole, and are not versioned in the same way that project documents are.

#### Step 1 - Identify Needed Changes
- Identify a change that needs to be made in the project and note the reasons why.
- Fill out the Change Request Form Template to reflect the identified changes needed.

Changes that are considered large enough to be accepted are:
- Changes to the timeline, specifically extensions of a week or more that cannot be resolved by 
- Change of approved scope.
- Result of a risk - infrastructure needs to be repaired or changed.
  
#### Step 2 - Submit Change Request Form
- Submit the completed Change Request Form to the Project Management Control directory for review.   
- The form should include a detailed description of the change, the reason for it, and any potential impacts on the project.

#### Step 3 - Review of Change Request
- The Change Request Form will need to be accepted by a majority of the team in order to be accepted.
- This review process may involve a meeting or discussion among the team members to understand the implications of the proposed change.
- A group decision will be made regarding the approval of the change and any refused Change Request Forms will be marked 'Denied'.
- A member of the project team will be assigned to any approved change for overseeing its progress. 

#### Step 4 - Implementation of Change
- The member assinged to manage the change, will implement the change and document the progress on the Change Request Form.
- A sub-task will be assinged in ProofHub to facilitate the change and its progress.
- The managing assigned member will ensure that the change is implemented as planned and that it achieves the desired outcome.

#### Step 5 - Monitor and Control
- The member assinged to manage the change, will monitor the impact of the change on the project and take any needed action if necessary.
- This could involve additional changes or adjustments to the project plan.
