## Project Overview:
Throughout this project, management will be handled as a shared effort. Each member is encouraged to express their thoughts and ideas whenever they believe it to be important. All members shall be open-minded and willing to work with each other.
## Project Team Organization:
MAJTeQ is comprised of five members which can be found in the header under the section "Assigned Members". The team will create and follow standards for organizing tasks, documentation, and other items such as diagrams or demonstrations.
### Team Roles and Responsibilities:
Each member of MAJTeQ is considered an equal and shall be treated accordingly. As it currently stands, there are general sections of the project that will be spearheaded by each member of the team. More information on this can be found within the Work Breakdown Sheet document. The sections have thus far been broken into: storage, network backbone, network front facing, security, cloud, and monitoring.
### Monitoring and Controlling Plans:
Team meetings are held at the start of each work period to ensure the tasks that must be completed are at the forethought of the team. Tasks in the Work Breakdown Sheet will be given a general schedule timeline for the time being, and will be updated as the project progresses. If a task is considered behind, that will be focused on by the assignee. If the task is still not able to be completed, the task will be assigned to another member with less tasks or who is waiting for the first task to be completed.
## Decision Making:
Decisions will be a team effort with a three-vote system put into place. Official change requests will follow the MAJTeQ change request form template, needing three members of the team to agree in order for the change to go through. 
## Conflict Resolution:
Conflict resolution will be handled via the members involved with the conflict through communication. If communicating does not lead to resolution within a reasonable time period, a member of the team will attempt conflict resolution via communication. If the conflict persists, an instructor will be involved.
