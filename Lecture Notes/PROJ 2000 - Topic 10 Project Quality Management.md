# Topic 10 - Project Quality Management

## What is Project Quality Management?
"The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements" - ISO9000:2000  
Conformance to requirements - project's processes and products meet written specifications  
Fitness for use - product can be used as it was intended - (what does it need to be put in production, ex. best practices, automatically deployable, etc.)  

**Project Quality Management Process**  
- **Planning Quality Management** - identifying what quality standards are relevant, and how to get to them.
- **Managing Quality** - translating the quality management plan into executable tasks
- **Controlling Quality** - monitoring specific project results to ensure they comply with relevant standards

**Planning Quality Management** implies the ability to anticipate situations and have the desired outcome  
**Defect prevention methods: **proper resources and methods, training people in quality, planning a process that ensure appropriate outcome

## Testing
Needs to be done almost every phase of systems development life cycle. (not just right before something goes out)
- testing just the parts that are supposed to be open? or are you going to test the things that **shouldn't** be open as well?
### Types of tests
**Unit** - tests each individual component to ensure it is defect free  
**Integration** - testing between unit and system testing - to test functionality of grouped components  
**System** - testing the entire system as one entity  
**User acceptance** - testing an independent test performed by end users prior to accepting the delivered system  

## Improving IT Quality
- leadership that promotes quality  
- understand the cost of quality  
- provide good workplace to enhance quality  
- work toward improving org's overall maturity level in project management / software development  

## Cost of quality
cost of conformance plus the cost of nonconformance
- **Conformance** - delivering products that meet requirements and fitness for use
- **Nonconformance** - taking responsibility for failures or not meeting quality expectations

## Cost of Quality on our Project
relates to time and grades
- redoing work
- taking longer on task "B" because task "A" was done wrong
- tasks not getting done on time

## Expectations for Quality on our Project
What has your team come to a decision on regarding quality?
- how are tasks being reported as done?
- is testing / verifying a part?
consistency is a major part of quality:
- how do you ensure all your VMs are standardized?
- how do you ensure your Routers, Switches, Firewalls are configured in a standardized fashion?
- Where do i go to understand the best practices?
## Tools and Methods for Project Quality
- Checklists - consistency helps streamline troubleshooting and documentation
- Best Practices
- Communication and Documentation
- "Second Eyes" - verifying configs
- Backups
- Test, test, and test some more.

## Our Project:
- as you go through WBS - who are you accountable to?
- How does one team member know that tasks have been completed?
- How does a team member know the technology is correct?
- What does quality look lie on your team?
- What questions should i be able to answer?
- It is week __ in the project, have i ever had "nothing to do today"?
	- if answer is yes, why?
