#### What is cost?
Cost is a resource sacrificed to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange
- usually measured in dollars
#### What is Project Cost Management?
Process required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget
- **Planning Cost Management** - determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost
- **Estimating Costs** - developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project
- **Determining the Budget** - allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance
- **Controlling Costs** - controlling changes to the project budget
#### Types of costs and benefits:
1. **Tangible Costs / Benefits** - cost/benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars
2. **Intangible costs / benefits** - cost/benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary terms - (more sick leave due to overwork/stress for example)
3. **Direct costs** - costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project
4. **Indirect Costs** - costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to the project (having to have employees trained)
5. **Sunk Cost** - money that has been spent in the past; when deciding what projects to invest in or continue, don't include sunk costs (sunk cost fallacy)

**Learning Curve Theory** - when many items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of those items decreases in a regular pattern as more units are produced - you get better at something and more efficient.  
**Reserves** - extra dollars to mitigate cost risk for difficult to predict future situations  
- **Contingency Reserves** - allow for future situations that may be partially planned for (known unknowns) and are included in the project cost baseline - project manager can use money as they deem fit  
- **Management Reserves** - allow for future situations that are unpredictable (unknown unknowns) - project manager has to get approval for spending  

#### Estimating Costs
Need to be taken seriously if a project is to be completed within budget
##### Types of Cost Estimate:
| type of estimate | when done | why done | typical range | example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) | super early, 3-5 years before project completion | provides estimate of cost for selection decision | -50% to +100% | i want a new car ~ $40k-$100k |
| Budgetary | early, 1-2 years out | puts dollars in the budget plans | -10% to + 25% | i want an SUV, from this brand ~ +/- $10k |
| Definitive | later in the project, less than 1 year out | puts dollars in the budget plans | -5% to + 10% | i want to get this car with this model, ~ +/- $2k |
##### Cost Estimation Tools and Techniques
- **Analogous / Top-down estimate** - use the actual cost of a previous (similar) project as the basis for estimating cost
- **Bottom-up estimate** - estimate individual work items or activities and summing them to get a project total
- **Three-point estimate** - estimating: most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic costs for items.
##### Typical Problems with IT Cost Estimates
Reasons for inaccuracies:
- estimates are done too quickly - things are often overlooked at this point, things like incompatibility (forgetting rails for servers)
- people lack estimating experience - people who don't know the dependencies of costs
- human beings are biased toward underestimation
- management desires accuracy - if you overestimate your budget repeatedly, you might build a reputation and get less budget
##### Developing a Cost Estimate
need to gather as much information as possible about the project before creating an estimate - ask how the organization is going to use the cost estimate
- use subject matter experts (SMEs) - get more than one price for services and products
##### Determining the Budget
- allocating the project cost estimate to individual work items over time (link to WBS)
##### Controlling Costs
- monitor cost performance
- informing project stakeholders of authorized changes to the project that will affect costs
tools:
- expert judgement
- data analysis
- project management information systems
- to-complete performance index
##### Software in Project Cost Management
**GANTT** chart is key
- accurate WBS
- accurate schedule
spreadsheets are common for resource planning, cost estimating, cost budgeting, cost control
