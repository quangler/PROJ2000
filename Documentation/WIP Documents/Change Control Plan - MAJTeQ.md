## Purpose:
This document is to describe how documents and infrastructure changes can be made and the process of said changes. This is due to the active project at hand, meaning things will change as progression continues.
## How to use this Document:
The Change Control Plan will be used to track committed changes and follow-through with confirmed changes from change request forms.
### Documentation
Documentation will have less restrictions on changes than the infrastructure as it is versioned and commits can be tracked through GitHub.  
Changes can be made by any member of the team at any time. If a change is made it is expected that the version of the document will be updated, and any changes made will briefly be described in the commit message to GitHub. The document should also be versioned in ProofHub under the task it relates to.
### Project Infrastructure
Changes related to project infrastructure has more restrictions attached to them as they are more impactful towards the project as a whole, and are not versioned in the same way that project documents are.
#### Step 1 - Identify Needed Changes
- Identify a change that needs to be made in the project and note the reasons why.
- Fill out the Change Request Form Template to reflect the identified changes needed.
It is important to note that the changes will need to be accepted by a majority of the team in order to be passed through.  

Changes that are considered large enough to be pushed forward are:
- Changes to the timeline, specifically extensions of a week or more that cannot be resolved by 
- Change of approved scope.
- Result of a risk - infrastructure needs to be repaired or changed.
