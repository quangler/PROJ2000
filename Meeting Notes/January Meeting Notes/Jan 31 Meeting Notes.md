Topics discussed - what we talked about (brief):

We should make a milestone based on what we think realistically we could get things done by.
- this means we have to go to our own tasks and estimate the times
- then turn those times into milestones
Project Status Report
- what have we done
	- documentation (break into sections)
	- planning (diagrams, VLANs)
- what are we doing next 
	- ip address scheme - **solidify** VLAN planning
	- set up the standard house keeping document
	- migrate the old VMs
	- setup server infrastructure
	- basic cabling


Outcomes - decisions we made
- [ ] - fill in the dates for your own tasks (April 12, hopeful deadline)
- [ ] - who is doing what in the WBS - dishing it out
- [ ] - updating WBS to have our own tasks
  
TLDR - notes summed up:
We will be doing milestones - put your hours into the WBS
