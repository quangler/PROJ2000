**Selecting Projects:**
need to have a narrowed down selection - picked strategically:
- focus on organizational needs
	- much more likely to be successful since they are seen as more important
	- examples: improve safety or increase morale
	- some important criteria for selecting projects:
		- need
		- funding
		- will
- categorize information technology projects
- perform financial analyses
	- **Return on Investment**
		- calculated by subtracting the project costs form the benefits and then dividing by the costs
		- higher the ROI, the better - some orgs have a minimum rate of ROI for a project
- use a weighted scoring model
- implement a balanced scorecard

#### Developing the Project Charter
Lets everyone else know what the plan is
- formal start of a project
**Project Charter**
#### Developing the Project Management Plan
Used to coordinate all project planning documents and help guide a project's execution and control
Common elements of a project management plan:
- intro/overview of project
- description of how project is organized
- management and technical processes used on the project
- work to be done
- schedule and budget information
- references to other project planning documents
#### Directing and Managing Project Work
Project planning and execution are intertwined - main function is to guide project execution
Those who will do the work should help plan the work
#### Monitoring and Controlling Project Work
Changes will happen, so its important to follow a process to monitor and control changes
#### Performing integrated change control
main objectives:
- influencing the factors that create changes to ensure that changes are beneficial
- determine that a change has occurred
- managing actual changes as they occur
#### Change Control on IT Projects
##### Former View:
The project team should strive to do exactly what was planned on time and within budget
**Problem:** project teams could rarely meet original project goals
##### Modern View:
Project management is a process of constant communication and negotiation
**Solution:** changes are often beneficial and the project team should plan for them

#### Change Control System
Formal, documented process that describes when and how official project documents and work may be changed
- describes who is authorized to make changes, paperwork required for these changes, and any automated or manual tracking systems the project will use
some points about it:
- plan for change
- establish a formal change control system
- use effective configuration management
- define procedures for making timely decisions about smaller changes
- use written and oral performance reports to help identify and manage change
- use project management software and other software to help manage and communicate changes
- focus on leading the project team and meeting overall project goals and expectations
#### Closing projects or phases
To close a project or phase, you must finalize all activities and transfer the completed or cancelled work to the appropriate people

#### Agile/Adaptive Environment
- iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team members
- expectations of the project manager do no change in an adaptive environment, but control of the detailed product planning and deliver is delegated to the team
- project managers using any product life cycle should focus on creating a collaborative decision-making environment and providing opportunities for team members to develop additional skills
