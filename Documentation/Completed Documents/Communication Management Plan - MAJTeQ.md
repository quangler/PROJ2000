## Stakeholder communications requirements:
Communications to stakeholders will be through formal documents with a standardized structure. This structure will contain a uniform title block, text sizing, font, and general text style - paragraph or bullet form. Communications to stakeholders shall be on time as requested by the stakeholder, completed to the fullest ability of the team.
## Communications summary:
Throughout the course of this project communication will be focused upon in order to maintain a collective understanding of the general project, as opposed to an individual only having knowledge of their own sections. The following schedule will be used to ensure this: 

| **Stakeholder** | **Communications Name** | **Delivery Method/Format** | **Producer** | **Due/Frequency** |  
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |  
| Project Team | Daily Meeting | Short meeting with digital copy of notes, uploaded in GitHub and ProofHub | Quinn Parent | Start of free time during PROJ class as needed |  
| Project Managers and Team | Weekly Status Report | Pre-Filled in document brought up during a meeting. | Project Manager | Alternating Wednesday and Thursdays |
During the daily meeting, notes will be taken and uploaded to the discussion section of the ProofHub with the title of that "day's date meeting notes". The notes will also be pushed to the GitHub repository that the team maintains for formal and general PROJ2000 documents.
## Comments/Guidelines:
Communication between the team members will be mostly informal with general project related communications taking place in person or through ProofHub discussions. Other non-project relating communications will take place on discord, examples of these would be alerting the team of an absence or late arrival. Meeting notes have a general template that should be followed for clarity sake; changes may be made in the future. Other documents that may be needed will follow their own general template as well, this will streamline the documentation process. Communications with stakeholders, as mentioned, will be in a more formal setting, following the title block, text sizing, and general text style structure that has been pre-set.

## Escalation procedures for resolving issues:
Escalation shall be done when a task is falling behind and the team member that is assigned to said task is unable to complete it in a timely manner. The expectation is for the team member to let the other members know during the daily meetings that they will be working on the task, or if they are unable to, let the team know so another member can help out. Depending on the task, it can be fully transferred over to another team member, or just have a second team member to help streamline the process. If a team member is falling behind on a task and does not let anyone know, inspection of the WBS progress in the Gantt chart will notify the team and allow for intervention if needed.
## Revision procedures for this document:
Revisions will be made to this, or any other document, as needed. The expectation for updating a document is to reversion the document in the title block, and let the team know when it is possible - whether that be through ProofHub, in-person, or even in Discord. Any document amendments are also expected to be put committed to the GitHub with a sufficient comment mentioning that the document has been updated, and possibly a brief overview of the changes made if they could be easily overlooked.
## Glossary of common terminology:
This list will be updated as terminology is expanded.
- VM - Virtual Machine - a virtual computer.  
- Hypervisor - a server that is able to have other virtual computers on it.  
- HA - High Availability - being able to have one server that can go down without it being noticeable to the end users.
